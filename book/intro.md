This textbook is written for the course [MUS2640 Sensing Sound and Music](https://www.uio.no/studier/emner/hf/imv/MUS2640/) at the University of Oslo. It is the foundation course for the study fields *music psychology* and *music technology*. Students are encouraged to take the following courses next [MUS2133 Music Psychology](https://www.uio.no/studier/emner/hf/imv/mus2133/) and [MUS2830 Computer Music](https://www.uio.no/studier/emner/hf/imv/MUS2830/). 

## Course Content

You will be introduced to fundamental principles of acoustics, psychoacoustics, and perception. This includes knowledge about how sound is produced in instruments, reflected in space, and perceived by humans. This is the foundation for how we experience pitch, timbre, harmony, and rhythm in music. You will also learn about computer-based representations of sound and music, and get an overview of digital audio, sound synthesis, and analysis. The course provides theoretical knowledge and practical skills for further studies of music psychology and technology.

## Learning Outcome

Having completed the course, you will:

- Be familiar with principles of how musical sound is produced and perceived.
- Understand relationships between sound-theoretical and music-theoretical concepts.
- Be able to process, synthesize, and analyze sound.

## Pedagogical Strategy

You should not expect traditional lectures. Instead, we will explore (musical) sound and music together through hands-on activities, discussions, and collaborative projects. The course emphasizes active participation and experiential learning, encouraging students to engage with the material in creative and critical ways. By working together, we aim to foster a deeper understanding of the subject matter and its applications.

## Open Education

The course material is developed from the perspective of Open Education, meaning that everything is freely and openly available. This approach ensures that students have unrestricted access to resources, enabling them to revisit and explore the material beyond the course duration. Open Education also promotes collaboration and sharing of knowledge within and outside the academic community.

Open Education aligns closely with the principles of Open Research, which emphasize transparency, accessibility, and reproducibility. In this course, we aim to integrate these principles by providing access to:

- **Open Data**: Wherever possible, datasets used in the course will be openly shared. This allows students to analyze, visualize, and interpret data independently, fostering a deeper understanding of the material and encouraging reproducibility in their work.

- **Open Source Code**: Tools, scripts, and examples provided during the course will be shared as open-source code. This enables students to study, modify, and build upon the code, promoting a hands-on approach to learning and encouraging contributions to the broader community.

- **Open Educational Resources (OER)**: All course materials, including lecture notes, assignments, and project guidelines, will be openly licensed. This ensures that students and educators worldwide can access and adapt the content for their own purposes.

- **Collaborative Research Opportunities**: Students will be encouraged to participate in research activities, contributing to ongoing projects or initiating their own. This hands-on involvement helps bridge the gap between learning and research, fostering a culture of inquiry and innovation.

By adopting these practices, the course not only supports students in their academic journey but also contributes to the global movement toward open and equitable access to knowledge. This approach empowers students to become active participants in the creation and dissemination of knowledge, preparing them for future roles as researchers, educators, and innovators.

## Psychology + Technology

By the end of the course, you will have learned some of the basic terminology, theories, and methods used in music psychology and music technology. This includes understanding how psychological principles apply to music perception and cognition, as well as how technological tools can be used to analyze and create music. The integration of these fields provides a holistic perspective on the study of sound and music.

#### Key Areas:
- **Musicology**: Study of music's history, theory, and cultural context.
- **Psychology**: Exploration of human perception, cognition, and behavior.
- **Technology**: Tools and methods for creating, analyzing, and manipulating sound.
- **Music Psychology**: How humans perceive and respond to music.
- **Music Technology**: Use of technology in music creation and analysis.
- **Psychological Technology**: Tools for studying human responses to sound and music.
- **Interdisciplinary Studies**: Integration of all three fields for a holistic understanding of sound and music.

### Basics of Psychology in Music

Psychology in music focuses on understanding how humans perceive, process, and respond to sound and music. This includes exploring topics such as:

- **Perception**: How the brain interprets sound waves as musical elements like pitch, rhythm, and timbre.
- **Cognition**: The mental processes involved in understanding and remembering music, including pattern recognition and emotional responses.
- **Behavior**: How music influences actions, such as movement, performance, and social interaction.
- **Emotion**: The study of how music evokes feelings and moods, and its role in emotional regulation and expression.

These principles help us understand the universal and individual ways in which music impacts human experience, providing insights into both the psychological and cultural dimensions of music.

### Basics of Technology in Music

Technology in music involves the use of tools and systems to create, analyze, and manipulate sound. Key areas include:

- **Sound Synthesis**: Generating sound electronically using techniques like additive, subtractive, and granular synthesis.
- **Digital Audio Processing**: Editing and transforming sound using software tools for tasks such as filtering, equalization, and effects.
- **Music Information Retrieval (MIR)**: Extracting meaningful information from audio data, such as tempo, key, and genre classification.
- **Interactive Systems**: Designing systems that respond to user input, enabling real-time music creation and performance.

These technologies expand the possibilities for music creation and analysis, offering new ways to explore and innovate within the field.
