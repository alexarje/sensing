# Week 2: Listening



## Different ways of listening

### Pierre Schaeffer's Sound Theory

Pierre Schaeffer (1910–1995), a French composer and musicologist, is renowned for pioneering **musique concrète**, a form of electroacoustic music that uses recorded sounds as raw material. His sound theory introduced groundbreaking concepts that reshaped how we perceive and compose with sound:

- **Sound Objects**: Schaeffer emphasized the importance of isolating sounds from their sources and meanings, treating them as abstract entities or "sound objects" for musical exploration.
- **Typology of Sonic Objects**: He categorized sounds based on their characteristics, such as iterative (repeated), sustained, and impulsive sounds, providing a framework for analyzing and composing with sound.
- **Reduced Listening**: A listening mode that focuses on the intrinsic qualities of sound itself—its texture, tone, and dynamics—rather than its source or semantic meaning.

Schaeffer's work laid the foundation for modern sound design, electronic music, and auditory research, influencing generations of composers and sound theorists.

### Michel Chion's Listening Modes

[Michel Chion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michel_Chion) (1947–) expanded on Pierre Schaeffer's theories of listening by categorizing listening into three distinct modes:

- **Causal listening**: Inspired by Schaeffer's focus on sound sources, this mode involves identifying and understanding the origin of a sound.
- **Semantic listening**: Building on Schaeffer's exploration of sound's meaning, this mode interprets sounds as part of a language or code.
- **Reduced listening**: Directly derived from Schaeffer's concept, this mode emphasizes analyzing the intrinsic qualities of sound—its texture, tone, and dynamics—without considering its source or meaning.

Chion's framework refines Schaeffer's ideas, providing a structured approach to understanding how listeners engage with sound in various contexts.

### Eric Clarke's Ecological Listening

[Eric Clarke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Clarke) explores the concept of **ecological listening**, which is grounded in **ecological perception theory**. This approach emphasizes:
- **Direct perception**: Listeners perceive sounds in relation to their environment without needing extensive cognitive processing.
- **Affordances**: Sounds provide cues about actions or interactions possible within a given environment.
- **Contextual listening**: The meaning of sounds is shaped by their environmental and situational context.

Clarke's work bridges psychology, musicology, and acoustic ecology, offering insights into how humans engage with sound as part of their lived experience.


#### R. Murray Schafer and Acoustic Ecology
[R. Murray Schafer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R._Murray_Schafer) (1933–2021) was a pioneer of the [World Soundscape Project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Soundscape_Project). He introduced key concepts such as:
- **[Soundscape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soundscape)**: The acoustic environment as perceived by humans.
- **[Schizophonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizophonia)**: The separation of a sound from its source, often through recording technology.
- **Composed environments**: The intentional design of soundscapes.

Schafer's contributions include the World Soundscape Project and the World Forum for Acoustic Ecology Conference.


#### Deep Listening
[Pauline Oliveros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pauline_Oliveros) (1932–2016) created the [Deep Listening](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Listening) practice, emphasizing:
- **Sonic awareness**: Heightened attention to sound and its context.
- The intersection of **[cybernetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybernetics)** and the creative process.

#### Musique Concrète and Pierre Schaeffer
[Pierre Schaeffer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Schaeffer) (1910–1995) founded [musique concrète](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musique_concr%C3%A8te), introducing:
- A **typology of sonic objects**: Iterative, sustained, and impulsive sounds.
- The concept of **sound objects**: Abstracted sounds used as compositional elements.

#### Critical and Cultural Perspectives
- **[Theodor Adorno](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodor_W._Adorno)**: Explored the critical theory of music and culture.
- **[Gilles Deleuze](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilles_Deleuze)**: Analyzed cultural aspects of sound and listening.
- **[Julia Kristeva](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_Kristeva)**: Investigated the creative process in sound.

### Soundwalking

#### Hildegard Westerkamp and Soundwalking
[Hildegard Westerkamp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hildegard_Westerkamp) (1946–) advocated for [soundwalking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soundwalking), a reflective practice of walking and listening to the environment. Her work was influenced by Schafer and the World Soundscape Project.

#### Key Concepts
- **[Barry Truax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_Truax)**: Explored synthesis and soundscape composition.
- **[Ecoacoustics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecoacoustics)**: The study of ecological relationships through sound.
- **[Acoustic ecology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acoustic_ecology)**: Examines the relationship between humans and their sonic environment.

#### Exercises
1. **Soundwalk Exercise**:
	- Walk slowly in a group, without talking.
	- Stop whenever you hear something interesting.
	- Write a note on why you stopped and what was interesting.

2. **Standstill Paradigm**:
	- Find a suitable location.
	- Stand still for ten minutes with closed eyes.
	- Listen to the environment.

#### Influential Works
- **[John Cage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cage)** (1912–1992): *[4'33''](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4%E2%80%B233%E2%80%B3)* (1952), a composition emphasizing silence and environmental sound.
- **[Simon Fraser University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Fraser_University)**: A hub for soundscape research and education.
