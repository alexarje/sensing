    "# Week 4: Psychoacoustics\n",
    "\n",
    "Psychoacoustics explores how humans perceive and interpret sound, bridging the gap between physical sound properties and subjective auditory experiences. Key topics include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Pitch Perception**: How frequency relates to pitch perception and its variability among individuals.\n",
    "- **Loudness**: The influence of sound intensity and duration on loudness perception.\n",
    "- **Timbre**: Characteristics that differentiate sounds with the same pitch and loudness, such as a violin versus a flute.\n",
    "- **Auditory Masking**: How certain sounds obscure or alter the perception of others.\n",
    "- **Spatial Hearing**: The ability to localize sound sources in three-dimensional space.\n",
    "- **Hearing Thresholds**: The limits of human hearing, from the quietest to the loudest perceivable sounds.\n",
    "\n",
    "Psychoacoustics is vital in fields like audio engineering, music production, and hearing aid design, informing how sound is optimized for human listeners.\n",

In psychoacoustics, this can manifest in auditory perception, where the perception of a sound may be influenced by previously heard sounds or stimuli. This concept is crucial in understanding how the auditory system adapts and reacts over time to varying acoustic environments.\n",
