# Week 4: Psychoacoustics

Psychoacoustics explores how humans perceive and interpret sound, bridging the gap between physical sound properties and subjective auditory experiences. Key topics include:

- **Pitch Perception**: How frequency relates to pitch perception and its variability among individuals.
- **Loudness**: The influence of sound intensity and duration on loudness perception.
- **Timbre**: Characteristics that differentiate sounds with the same pitch and loudness, such as a violin versus a flute.
- **Auditory Masking**: How certain sounds obscure or alter the perception of others.
- **Spatial Hearing**: The ability to localize sound sources in three-dimensional space.
- **Hearing Thresholds**: The limits of human hearing, from the quietest to the loudest perceivable sounds.

Psychoacoustics is vital in fields like audio engineering, music production, and hearing aid design, informing how sound is optimized for human listeners.

## Anatomy of the Ear

The human ear is a sophisticated organ responsible for detecting sound and maintaining balance. It consists of three main parts:

### Outer Ear
- **Components**: The **pinna** (visible part) and the **ear canal**.
- **Function**: Collects sound waves and directs them to the **eardrum**, causing vibrations.

### Middle Ear
- **Components**: Three tiny bones called the **ossicles** ([malleus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malleus), [incus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incus), and [stapes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stapes)).
- **Function**: Amplifies eardrum vibrations and transmits them to the **oval window**.

### Inner Ear
- **Components**: The **cochlea** ([cochlea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochlea)) and the **vestibular system** ([vestibular system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vestibular_system)).
- **Function**: Converts mechanical vibrations into electrical signals via hair cells and maintains balance.

## Psychoacoustics: A Detailed Breakdown

### Sensation

#### Auditory System
The auditory system processes sound through three main parts:
- **Outer Ear**: Collects sound waves. [Learn more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_ear)
- **Middle Ear**: Amplifies sound vibrations. [Learn more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_ear)
- **Inner Ear**: Converts vibrations into electrical signals. [Learn more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner_ear)

### Perception

#### Frequency
- **Infrasound**: Below 20 Hz. [Learn more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrasound)
- **Audible Sound**: 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz. [Learn more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_range)
- **Ultrasound**: Above 20,000 Hz. [Learn more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound)

##### Instruments
- **Piano**: 32 Hz to 4186 Hz. [Learn more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piano)
- **Saxophone**: Known for its rich tone. [Learn more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saxophone)

##### Just Noticeable Differences (JND)
The smallest detectable frequency change. [Learn more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-noticeable_difference)

#### Loudness
- **Equal-Loudness Contours**: Show how loudness perception varies. [Learn more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal-loudness_contour)

The Fletcher-Munson curves, also known as equal-loudness contours, illustrate how human hearing sensitivity varies with frequency and loudness levels.

#### Hysteresis
Hysteresis refers to the phenomenon where the response of a system depends not only on its current state but also on its past states. In psychoacoustics, this can manifest in auditory perception, where the perception of a sound may be influenced by previously heard sounds or stimuli. This concept is crucial in understanding how the auditory system adapts and reacts over time to varying acoustic environments.
