# Week 11: The Musical Brain



## Psychology

### Music Perception and Cognition

Music perception and cognition involve complex processes in the brain that integrate sensory, emotional, and cognitive functions. When listening to music, the auditory cortex processes sound waves, identifying pitch, rhythm, and timbre. The prefrontal cortex contributes to recognizing patterns and predicting musical structure, while the motor cortex is often activated, even when passively listening, due to the rhythmic elements of music.

The limbic system, including the amygdala and hippocampus, plays a key role in the emotional response to music, linking melodies to memories and evoking feelings. Additionally, the reward system, involving the release of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens, is activated during pleasurable musical experiences.

Music cognition also engages higher-order brain functions, such as attention, memory, and decision-making. Studies have shown that musical training can enhance neuroplasticity, improving cognitive abilities and even aiding in language processing and problem-solving.

Research continues to explore how these interconnected brain regions work together, shedding light on the profound impact of music on human cognition and emotion.


## Technology

### EEG (Electroencephalography)

Electroencephalography (EEG) is a method used to record electrical activity of the brain. It is commonly used in neuroscience, cognitive psychology, and clinical diagnostics. EEG measures voltage fluctuations resulting from ionic current within the neurons of the brain.

### fNIRS (Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy)

Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a non-invasive imaging technique that uses near-infrared light to measure brain activity. It is often used in cognitive neuroscience and neurorehabilitation studies.

### MEG (Magnetoencephalography)

Magnetoencephalography (MEG) is a neuroimaging technique for mapping brain activity by recording magnetic fields produced by electrical currents occurring naturally in the brain. It is particularly useful for studying brain function and connectivity.

### fMRI (Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging)

Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) is a technique that measures and maps brain activity by detecting changes associated with blood flow. It is widely used in neuroscience and psychology to study brain function.
