# Week 1: Tuning in


## Sound and music

Sound and music are fundamental to human experience, serving as both a medium of communication and a form of artistic expression. Sound is a physical phenomenon characterized by vibrations that travel through a medium, while music is an organized arrangement of sounds that evoke emotional, cognitive, and cultural responses. Research in music psychology highlights how humans perceive and process sound, exploring topics such as pitch, rhythm, timbre, and harmony. Technological advancements, such as digital audio workstations and sound synthesis, have expanded the boundaries of music creation and analysis, enabling new forms of artistic exploration.

## Hearing vs listening

Hearing is the passive physiological process of detecting sound waves through the auditory system, while listening is an active cognitive process that involves interpreting and making meaning of those sounds. In music cognition, listening is a complex activity that engages attention, memory, and emotional processing. Studies have shown that active listening can enhance musical appreciation and understanding, as well as improve auditory skills. Differentiating between hearing and listening is crucial for developing a deeper connection to music and sound in both educational and performance contexts.

## Embodied music cognition

Embodied music cognition emphasizes the role of the body in musical experience, suggesting that music is not only heard but also felt and enacted. This perspective integrates sensory, motor, and emotional dimensions, proposing that musical understanding arises from physical interaction with sound. Research in this field explores phenomena such as entrainment, where listeners synchronize their movements to a musical beat, and the role of gestures in musical performance. By engaging the body, embodied music cognition provides a holistic framework for studying how music is experienced and understood.

## Action and Perception

A theoretical starting point is that of ecological psychology, which posits that we sense through action, and we act through sensing. This is called the action-perception loop. In music, this loop is evident in activities such as playing an instrument, where sensory feedback informs motor actions, and vice versa. For example, a pianist adjusts their touch based on the sound produced, creating a continuous cycle of interaction. Practical exercises, such as improvisation and movement-based activities, can help students explore this dynamic relationship, deepening their understanding of how sensory input and motor output are intertwined in musical contexts.

## Psychological vs technological approaches to sound and music

Psychological approaches to sound and music focus on understanding human perception, cognition, and emotion. These approaches investigate how individuals experience music, from the neural mechanisms of auditory processing to the cultural and social factors that shape musical preferences. In contrast, technological approaches leverage tools such as audio analysis algorithms, machine learning, and virtual reality to study and create music. While psychological approaches emphasize the human element, technological approaches provide new methods for analyzing and generating sound. Integrating these perspectives can lead to innovative insights, bridging the gap between human experience and technological possibilities in music.

Multimodality refers to the integration and interaction of multiple sensory modalities—such as vision, hearing, touch, and proprioception—in the perception and understanding of the world. From a psychological perspective, multimodality emphasizes how the brain combines information from these different sensory channels to create a cohesive and enriched experience. In the context of music cognition, this could involve the interplay between auditory and motor systems, such as how visual cues from a performer influence the perception of sound or how physical gestures enhance musical expression and understanding.
