# Sensing Sound and music

This course is called "Sensing Sound and Music". But what does that mean? And what do those three words mean on their own?

```{admonition} Question
:class: question
Can you define the three terms "sensing", "sound", and "music"?
```

Sound and music are fundamental to human experience, serving as both a medium of communication and a form of artistic expression. *Sound* is a physical phenomenon characterized by vibrations that travel through a medium, while *music* is an organized arrangement of sounds that evoke emotional, cognitive, and cultural responses. Humans *sense* sound through our auditory system, but as we will discuss throughout the course, also through our bodies. Exactly how we "sense" music is still one of the core questions of both musicology at large and music psychology more specifically. It is also of interest to music technology.

Research in music psychology highlights how humans perceive and process sound, exploring topics such as pitch, rhythm, timbre, and harmony. Technological advancements, such as digital audio workstations and sound synthesis, have expanded the boundaries of music creation and analysis, enabling new forms of artistic exploration.

## An interdisciplinary approach

This course aims at being *interdisciplinary*, meaning that it draws on methods, theories, and perspectives from multiple academic fields to address complex questions about sound and music. Interdisciplinarity goes beyond simply combining knowledge from different areas; in this case between musicology, psychology and technology. The idea is that by approaching sound and music from these varied viewpoints, we gain a richer understanding of how humans perceive, experience, and create music, as well as how technology can enhance and transform these processes.

### Some etymology

[Etymology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etymology) is the study of the origin and history of words and how their meanings and forms have changed over time. The word "etymology" is itself derived from the Ancient Greek words ἔτυμον (étymon), meaning 'true sense or sense of a truth', and the suffix -logia, denoting 'the study or logic of'. Similarly, we can investigate the three disciplines in question: 

- **Musicology**: The term "musicology" comes from the Greek words *mousikē* (music) and *-logia* (study or science). It is the scholarly study of music, covering its history, theory, and cultural context. Musicologists analyze how music is composed, performed, and understood across different societies and eras.

- **Psychology**: "Psychology" is derived from the Greek *psyche* (soul, mind) and *-logia* (study). It is the scientific study of the mind and behavior. In the context of music, psychology explores how people perceive, process, and respond to music emotionally and cognitively.

- **Technology**: The word "technology" originates from the Greek *techne* (art, craft, skill) and *-logia* (study). Technology refers to the tools, techniques, and systems humans create to solve problems or enhance capabilities. In music, technology includes instruments, recording devices, software, and other innovations that help create, analyze, or experience music.

```{admonition} Question
:class: question
Can you think of other words with a "logy" at the end? What do they mean?
```

By the end of the course, you will have learned some of the basic terminology, theories, and methods used in all these directions. 

### Differences between disciplinarities

When approaching different disciplines, it is important to understand how they interact. Many people call all sorts of collaboration between disciplines for "interdisciplinarity". However, there are some differences, highlighted in this figure: 

![Different disciplinarities](https://www.arj.no/images/2022/03/01-disciplinarities-crop.pdf-1-1024x294.png)

Intradisciplinary work stays within a single discipline, while crossdisciplinary approaches view one discipline from the perspective of another. Multidisciplinary collaboration involves people from different disciplines working together, each drawing on their own expertise. Interdisciplinary work integrates knowledge and methods from multiple disciplines, synthesizing approaches for deeper understanding. Transdisciplinary approaches go further, creating unified intellectual frameworks that transcend individual disciplinary boundaries.

One approach is not better than another and many researchers combine their approach dependent on the project type. Still, it is helpful to consider these differences when we start approaching each discipline and look at how they combine theories and methods. 

```{admonition} Question
:class: question
How do you define your own background in terms of disciplinarity?
```


### Concepts, theories, methods

An academic discipline is generally characterized by a distinct set of concepts, theories, and methods that guide inquiry and knowledge production within a particular field. Disciplines have established traditions, specialized terminology, and recognized standards for evaluating research and scholarship. They often possess dedicated journals, conferences, and professional organizations that foster communication and development among practitioners. The boundaries of a discipline are shaped by its historical evolution, core questions, and the types of problems it seeks to address, providing a framework for systematic study and advancement of understanding.

In our case, each of the three involved disciplines (musicology, psychology, and technology) brings its own theories and methods. Generally speaking, musicology uses analysis, historiography, and ethnography, psychology employs experiments and surveys, and technology relies on engineering and computational modeling. Understanding these differences helps clarify how interdisciplinary research can integrate diverse perspectives to enrich our knowledge of sound and music.

## Fundamentals of Music Psychology

Psychology in music focuses on understanding how humans perceive, process, and respond to sound and music. This includes exploring topics such as:

- **Perception**: How the brain interprets sound waves as musical elements like pitch, rhythm, and timbre.
- **Cognition**: The mental processes involved in understanding and remembering music, including pattern recognition and emotional responses.
- **Behavior**: How music influences actions, such as movement, performance, and social interaction.
- **Emotion**: The study of how music evokes feelings and moods, and its role in emotional regulation and expression.

These principles help us understand the universal and individual ways in which music impacts human experience, providing insights into both the psychological and cultural dimensions of music. In this course, we will primarily investigate perception, but also touch briefly upon cognition and behavior.

Music psychology is a thriving field internationally. There are numerous international communities, conferences and journals for music psychology. These conferences provide excellent opportunities for networking, collaboration, and staying updated on the latest research.

Given its interdisciplinary nature, researchers are typically working in either musicology or psychology departments, which also often "skews" the research in one or the other direction. Researchers more on the musicology side tend to be more focused on real-world musical experiences, what is often termed "ecological validity" and using (more) qualitative methods. Researchers more on the psychology side typically work more on controlled experiments and using quantitative methods.

While many researchers in music psychology may often feel "alone" in their respective departments, there are a few larger and specialized departments or research centers that focus on music psychology specifically. In these institutions, one can often see the width of the field, covering many different theoretical and methodological perspectives. 

## Fundamentals of Music Technology

Technology in music involves the use of tools and systems to create, analyze, and manipulate sound. Key areas include:

- **Sound Synthesis**: Generating sound electronically using techniques like additive, subtractive, and granular synthesis.
- **Digital Audio Processing**: Editing and transforming sound using software tools for tasks such as filtering, equalization, and effects.
- **Music Information Retrieval (MIR)**: Extracting meaningful information from audio data, such as tempo, key, and genre classification.
- **Interactive Systems**: Designing systems that respond to user input, enabling real-time music creation and performance.

These technologies expand the possibilities for music creation and analysis, offering new ways to explore and innovate within the field. There are also many international journals, communities and annual conferences in music technology.

When comparing them, there are some important differences between music technology and music psychology as disciplines. Music psychology is primarily a *scientific* field of study, focused on understanding how humans perceive, process, and respond to music through empirical research and theoretical frameworks. Its methods are rooted in experimental design, data analysis, and psychological theory, aiming to uncover universal principles and individual variations in musical experience.

Music technology, on the other hand, spans several domains: science, art, design, and engineering. It encompasses scientific research into sound and audio processing, artistic exploration through composition and performance, design of musical instruments and interfaces, and engineering of hardware and software systems. Music technologists may work on developing new tools for music creation, analyzing audio signals, designing interactive installations, or exploring creative possibilities in digital media. This diversity means that music technology is not limited to scientific inquiry but also includes creative practice, technical innovation, and user-centered design.

Given its many directions, music technologists typically work in many different types of departments: computer science, eletrical or mechanical engineering, design and art schools, but also within musicology departments and music conservatories. As for psychologists, this instutional basis often also influences the directions taken. 

## Listening to the world

### Hearing vs listening

```{exercise}
Stand up, close your eyes, and listen to the environment. What do you hear?
```

Hearing is the passive physiological process of detecting sound waves through the auditory system, while listening is an active cognitive process that involves interpreting and making meaning of those sounds. In music cognition, listening is a complex activity that engages attention, memory, and emotional processing. Studies have shown that active listening can enhance musical appreciation and understanding, as well as improve auditory skills. Differentiating between hearing and listening is crucial for developing a deeper connection to music and sound in both educational and performance contexts.

### Embodied music cognition

Embodied music cognition emphasizes the role of the body in musical experience, suggesting that music is not only heard but also felt and enacted. This perspective integrates sensory, motor, and emotional dimensions, proposing that musical understanding arises from physical interaction with sound. Research in this field explores phenomena such as entrainment, where listeners synchronize their movements to a musical beat, and the role of gestures in musical performance. By engaging the body, embodied music cognition provides a holistic framework for studying how music is experienced and understood.

### Action and Perception

A theoretical starting point is that of ecological psychology, which posits that we sense through action, and we act through sensing. This is called the action-perception loop. In music, this loop is evident in activities such as playing an instrument, where sensory feedback informs motor actions, and vice versa. For example, a pianist adjusts their touch based on the sound produced, creating a continuous cycle of interaction. Practical exercises, such as improvisation and movement-based activities, can help students explore this dynamic relationship, deepening their understanding of how sensory input and motor output are intertwined in musical contexts.

```{note} Multimodality
Multimodality refers to the integration and interaction of multiple sensory modalities—such as vision, hearing, touch, and proprioception—in the perception and understanding of the world. From a psychological perspective, multimodality emphasizes how the brain combines information from these different sensory channels to create a cohesive and enriched experience. In the context of music cognition, this could involve the interplay between auditory and motor systems, such as how visual cues from a performer influence the perception of sound or how physical gestures enhance musical expression and understanding.
